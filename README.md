# Quantum Galton Board: Road to a Universal Statistical Simulator

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Quantum Galton Board.ipynb`) that implements various quantum Galton board (QGB) circuits, building upon the principles detailed in the research paper "Universal Statistical Simulator.pdf" by Mark Carney and Ben Varcoe. The project aims to provide an intuitive and efficient demonstration of exponential speedup offered by quantum processors for statistical simulations.

## Project Overview

The classical Galton board, a device that demonstrates the binomial distribution, serves as an excellent analogy for understanding quantum computation's advantages without requiring deep knowledge of computational complexity. This work extends the classical concept to the quantum realm, creating circuits that generate superpositions of all possible trajectories, which can then be sampled to obtain statistical distributions.

The key innovation lies in mimicking the physical action of individual pegs on a classical Galton board within a quantum circuit using primarily Clifford operations (Hadamard, CNOT, SWAP) and ancilla qubits.

## Key Features and Implementations

The notebook explores different variants of the Quantum Galton Board, each offering unique capabilities for statistical simulation:

1.  **Standard Quantum Galton Board (QGB)**:
    * **Core Idea:** Models the action of an individual peg, where a "quantum ball" (represented by an X-gated qubit) falls through a series of superposed SWAP operations.
    * **Resource Efficiency:** For an $n$-level QGB (producing $n+1$ output bits), the circuit uses approximately $O(n^2)$ gates. Specifically, the upper bound for $n$ desired output bits is $2n^2 + 5n + 2$ gates.
    * **Circuit Depth:** This implementation boasts a significantly lower circuit depth compared to previous approaches. This reduction in depth is crucial for mitigating errors on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.
    * **Output:** Generates outputs where precisely a single '1' is present, requiring post-processing to convert to a more conventional normally distributed output.

2.  **Biased Quantum Galton Board (B-QGB)**:
    * **Control over Distribution:** Introduces bias to the output distribution, moving beyond the uniform probabilities of a standard QGB.
    * **Mechanism:** Achieved by replacing the Hadamard gate in the "quantum peg" module with an $R_x(\theta)$ rotation gate[cite: 1]. [cite_start]The angle $\theta$ directly controls the bias (e.g., $\theta = 2\pi/3$ for a 75% bias towards one output branch)[cite: 1].
    * **Gate Count:** The maximum gate count for an $n$-level biased QGB is approximately $3(n^2+n)+n+2$ gates, accounting for additional RESET and $R_x(\theta)$ gates per peg row[cite: 1].

## Exponential Speedup

The core advantage highlighted is the quantum circuit's ability to calculate $2^n$ trajectories using only $O(n^2)$ resources, demonstrating an exponential speedup over classical calculations for statistical simulations. This is achieved by creating a superposition of all possible trajectories simultaneously.

## Installation and Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you will need to have Python and the necessary quantum computing libraries installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AyomideOlumideAttah/Quantum-Galton-Boards.git](https://github.com/AyomideOlumideAttah/Quantum-Galton-Boards.git)
    cd AyomideOlumideAttah
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    The notebook uses specific versions of Qiskit and related libraries. You can install them by running the following commands within your activated environment:
    ```bash
    !pip3 install --upgrade pip
    !pip install qiskit==1.3
    !pip install qiskit-aer==0.15
    !pip install pylatexenc==2.10
    !pip install qiskit_ibm_runtime==0.34.0
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a browser window where you can navigate to and open `Quantum Galton Board.ipynb`.
